Create the folder of our project - "Malware Detection using YARA Rules"  But remember to follow my instructions when creating the structure of our folder

after creating the folder with proper structure , now it's time to run and test our project 

we can run this from different methods and one of them is using cmd(command prompt)

simple locate your folder where you created the main project by following this command below:

cd "YOUR DISK\DRIVE NAME\FOLDER NAME\MALWARE-DETECTION-USING-YARA-RULES" (without space's)

and when opening the folder run this command:

cd scripts/venv/activate (make sure you have venv or .env file present in that particular folder and if not follow this steps : 1.Run create venv in that folder only)

and after this go with our final command:

run app.py (make sure you have app.py file present in that folder before running the command)

now just open the website and scan your text files and and other files also
