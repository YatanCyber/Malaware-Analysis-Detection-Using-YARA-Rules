This is a harmless demo file created to trigger the MEDIUM YARA rule.

It contains encoded and obfuscated script indicators:

powershell.exe -enc
FromBase64String

CreateObject("WScript.Shell")
Execute("cmd.exe /c echo test")

Simulated suspicious hex patterns (not real shellcode):

è"3D

This file is safe and meant for detection testing only.
